## What is Mythical?

It's a tooling refactor of Mithril.js to shed extra dependencies to make development / refactoring cleaner.

A modern client-side JavaScript framework for building Single Page Applications. It's small (<!-- size -->10.12 KB<!-- /size --> gzipped), fast and provides routing and XHR utilities out of the box.

Mythical supports IE11, Firefox ESR, and the last two versions of Firefox, Edge, Safari, and Chrome. No polyfills required. ðŸ‘Œ
